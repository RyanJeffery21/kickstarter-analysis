# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview
Analyze Kickstarter data to give Louise the best chance for success in her fundraising efforts.
### Purpose
Louise is attempting to raise approximately $10,000 to fund her play, Fever.  Using data from other crowdfunded projects, we are attempting to find patterns that will help Louise understand what will make a successful campaign.  Using these insights, Louise can understand when the most successful projects are started and how their fundraising goals also affect success.  
## Analysis and Challenges
Using the data from Kickstarter, we converted the start and end dates into readable formats and we broke down the campaigns into parent and subcategories.  Using this more relevant data, we were able to create charts and tables that show the relationship between start dates, goals, and success.  
### Analysis Based on Launch Date
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://github.com/RyanJeffery21/kickstarter-analysis/blob/ff7ff3dabc23c936ea7d8519a0ad2616a3c46b55/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)

Using the chart above, it can be seen that the most successful theater campaigns have a start date in the month of May and begin to trail off in the months of June and July.  The month of December appears to have the least success, while the other eight months of the year all have similar success rates.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


Based on this research, it is my recommendation to start the campaign in the month of May with a goal of raising $3.000.  This should give you the best chance to succeed in your fundraising efforts.
