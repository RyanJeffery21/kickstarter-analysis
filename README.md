# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview
Analyze Kickstarter data to give Louise the best chance for success in her fundraising efforts.
### Purpose
Louise is attempting to raise approximately $10,000 to fund her play, Fever.  Using data from other crowdfunded projects, we are attempting to find patterns that will help Louise understand what will make a successful campaign.  Using these insights, Louise can understand when the most successful projects are started and how their fundraising goals also affect success.  
## Analysis and Challenges
Using the data from Kickstarter, we converted the start and end dates into readable formats and we broke down the campaigns into parent and subcategories.  Using this more relevant data, we were able to create charts and tables that show the relationship between start dates, goals, and success.  
### Analysis Based on Launch Date

Using the chart above, it can be seen that the most successful theater campaigns have a start date in the month of May and begin to trail off in the months of June and July.  The month of December appears to have the least success, while the other eight months of the year all have similar success rates.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Analyzing the data of other theater projects, we see that other projects with a goal of $10,000 had a 55% chance of success.  Dropping the goal down to between $1,000 and $4,999 greatly increased the success rate of similar projects.  This chart suggests that in order for Louise to be successful, she should run a campaign that is aiming to raise less than her original goal of $10,000.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No difficulties encountered
## Results
- Based on the Launch Date data, it would be recommended to start the campaign in the month of either May or June.  It can also be inferred that starting the campaign in December or January would not lead to success.
- Using the Outcomes Based on Goals data, it is recommended to start a campaign with a goal of less than $4,999 to have the greatest chance of success.  Louise's goal of $10,000 would seem to have a roughly 50/50 percent chance of success.
- Expanding this data set to have more relevant campaigns would allow for greater clarity in the set.
- Creating a table that shows only plays and includes their goals and total funding raised.  This would allow us to see how well the campaigns did in relation to their goals.
